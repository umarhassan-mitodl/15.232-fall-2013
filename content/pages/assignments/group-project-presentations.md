**Scenario: You're (almost) Hired!**

Your team has found the perfect job doing impactful work to improve health outcomes in an emerging market. You've passed the first-round interview and are confident that the organization recognizes that your team is completely qualified for a leadership role.

Now, you're on to the second-round interview with the Board of Directors who will determine whether your team will be hired to run the healthcare organization or program.

**Exercise**

The Board of Directors will already have read your cogent and compelling 2-page executive summary, submitted earlier. They are expecting a 12 minute presentation highlighting your assessment of the organization's performance and your explanation of the causes of its performance, along with a few key things you would change if you were to lead the enterprise. It's likely you'll need to discuss the goal of the organization or program, because it helps you establish the criteria for your assessment.

After the presentation, the Board will ask you a few questions and decide whether to hire your team. Then they will vote!

**Tips for Students**

*   You have time to present only _a subset of your entire deck_. You may choose how many slides to show, but a half-dozen or fewer is a good number.
*   Not everyone needs to present, but all may do so. Please _practice and polish_ your presentation.
*   Manage your time! Helpfully, a chime will go off at 11 minutes.
*   Submit the version you would like to show in class by 5 pm the previous evening.
*   Do not focus on why your team is qualified for the leadership position, as is already established.
*   Refer to our {{% resource_link 17f486b3-edd7-225e-e17f-0541c81d7bee "\"dummy deck\" ppt template (PPT)" %}} for what to cover, but feel free to any layout and presentation method that works for you. A well-designed graphic to show the organization’s operational model is an excellent idea.
*   Focus your talk on a small number of specific points—_things you appreciate about the program or organization; things you would change_—and bring in the background data, framing, and organizational description needed to make your points and _provide evidence for your assertions_. Do not try to present everything about the organization.
*   Use _concepts or examples from class_ to aid your analysis, where relevant.
*   The audience, which includes the students not presenting and invited guests, will be your board of directors.
*   Our class session may generate new ideas and suggest improvements to your work. To make updates, debrief with your team and make sure to tap into the guest's comments, class's feedback, and your own assessment of your work to _refine and revise your presentation and executive summary and craft a team memo on what you learned from the class._ Turn in the final set of materials on the last day of class.
*   We will post your work on our website in the coming months with a creative commons license and your names included.

**Once we have heard from the Presenting Teams**

The second half of our class session will be an open discussion forum with our special guests adding any comments or themes they would like to share, and you'll have a chance to join everyone in the dialog and help us all connect ideas and insights from the full set of organizations we've studied—so you'll want to pay attention to the other presentations too.
