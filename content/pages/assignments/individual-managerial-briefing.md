## Managerial Briefing on a Selected Global Health Need

Assignment 1 is designed to get you thinking about some key facts from a managerial perspective. You’ll synthesize research from online sources to develop a picture of a critical disease or healthcare need.

## Why this Assignment?

As we consider a variety of health care enterprises in the weeks ahead, it will be useful to have some basic knowledge of relevant diseases and healthcare needs. In particular, understanding more about how the disease is detected and treated, the progression of the disease or condition, affected populations, and care requirements will equip us to assess the effectiveness of each enterprise with respect to the healthcare needs it addresses. In the class sessions to come, you'll draw on this work.

## Your Task

Choose one disease or medical need, and develop a *cogent briefing on the key facts* that would be *relevant to a manager, investor, or consultant working* with a global health organization in that domain. Your briefing should fit onto two pages, so it will need to be high-level. Please use effective formatting to convey the key points, choosing a layout that maximizes the information content. Short paragraphs with informative headings are likely to be useful, and you may also use bullet points or some other method to communicate essential information cogently.

Choose from the following:

- Malaria
- Maternal and neonatal health
- HIV/AIDS
- Eye disease
- Primary care
- Surgical services, including cardiac
- Tuberculosis
- Another disease or condition

## What to Include in your Assignment?

Create a stand-alone word document to upload. Your briefing should include:

- Your name.
- A title that refers to the disease, condition, or care domain.
- A one-sentence definition of the disease or condition.
- How the disease is contracted and how it develops over time. Mention co-morbidities. Overview or map the main steps in the progression of the disease or condition.
- Who is affected: numbers, proportion, and other demographic or market information?
- Available treatment and prevention options. Mention the effects of not getting appropriate treatment.
- Differences in incidence and care in across settings, including inequities.
- What inputs are most needed to prevent, treat, or manage this disease or condition? Identify key requirements for a patient’s care, mentioning needed services, knowledge, medication, and supplies that are essential for reducing the negative impacts of this disease or condition.
- To wrap up, highlight what you’ve gleaned about timing, costs, and complexity of care delivery.

*List your sources*: consult the {{% resource_link "f015f342-7f1f-4b38-9d1e-2af4a04fd1aa" "**ASA style sheet (PDF)**" %}} for formatting advice. Make sure to include urls that work (click on each to check, once you’ve pasted into your document).

Limit your entire document (excluding references) to *two pages*. Single-spaced text and narrow margins are fine.
