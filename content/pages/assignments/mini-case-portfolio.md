**Check-In Meeting:** Each team is required to meet with the course team to seek feedback on their draft presentation and executive summary. This meeting takes place the week of class 9.

**In-Class Team Presentation:** Your team will present a subset of your slides in class 10, 11, or 12. We will distribute your draft executive summary to your classmates and our invited guests before your presentation, and therefore should be as polished and complete as possible. See the {{% resource_link 3b4ca32b-96a6-bb2a-3c9b-97075fe806ef "detailed instructions for group project presentations" %}}.

Final Draft of Mini Case Portfolio
----------------------------------

**Final Group Project Executive Summary, Presentation Deck, Bibliography, and Team Learning Memo:** Taking into account feedback and discussions, refine your executive summary and presentation deck for class 12. Check that your bibliography is complete. This material will be uploaded to the web for others to read and download, and could be useful to many others. Also prepare a 2-page team memo documenting what you learned from this class.
